refactoring!


## ✨ features

- calculate water up-take coefficients ("Kc factors") for Winter Wheat,
  Spring Barley, Maize, and Grassland based on the daily air surface
  temperature


## 🐛 known issues

- calculating Grassland Kc_factors requires much memory


## 💸 funding

The implementation of ARIS_lite in Python, this repository, is funded by
the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG, www.ffg.at) as part of
CropShift.
